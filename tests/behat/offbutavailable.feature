  Scenario: Do not run if Filter is Off
    Given I am on the "PageName1" "page activity editing" page logged in as teacher1
    And I set the field "Page content" to "<p>```</p><p>echo \"Hello\";</p><p>```<br></p><code><pre>echo \"Hello\";</code></pre>"
    When I click on "Save and display" "button"
    And I wait until the page is ready
    Then ".hljs" "css_element" should not exist
    And ".hljs-attribute" "css_element" should not exist
    And I log out
    And I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "PageName1"
    Then ".hljs" "css_element" should not exist
    And ".hljs-attribute" "css_element" should not exist
